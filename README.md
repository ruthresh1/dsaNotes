# Data Structures and Algorithm Notes

## This is more for myself than for the general public. ;)
This does not mean that you cannot use it.
I always wanted to have good notes on DSA, as there is no book big enough to have all the information.
Also, digital is the way to go, so why not.

I have in mind a simple structure of how to organize this info. DM if you have any suggestions.
