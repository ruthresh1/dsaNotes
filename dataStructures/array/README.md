# Arrays and Strings

## Array

Contiguous blocks of memory that can store data of same type (homogenous data)
Eg. A tie box

### Properties
* Fixed size (not dynamic)
* indexed 
* quick access

### Big O
| Operation | Big O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Access    | O(1)  |
| Search    | O(1)  |
| Insertion | O(n)  |
| Deletion  | O(n)  |
---------------------

### Why Array?
Usually while programming we deal with a list/set of common data for which we need them to be stored some where. 
Instead of using individual variables, we use an array.

### Array Types
1. 1-D Array
2. 2-D Array
3. N-D Array

--------------------------------------
### Java

Arrays in Java are awesome
Creation
```java
int arr[] = new int[10];
arr[0] = 1;
arr[0];     // 1
arr[1];     // 0
arr.length; // 10
```

### Python
Arrays in Python are called lists, unlike in Java they are mutable and not fixed.
A tuple is fixed size immutable list

```python
arr = []
```

## String
