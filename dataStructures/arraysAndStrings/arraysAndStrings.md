# Arrays and Strings

## Array

Contiguous blocks of memory that can store data of same type (homogenous data)
Eg. A tie box

Properties
* Fixed size (not dynamic)
* indexed 
* quick access

Why Array?
Usually while programming we deal with a list/set of common data for which we need them to be stored some where. 
Instead of using individual variables, we use an array.
